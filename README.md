# ðŸŽ§ LAM (Large Audio Model) for Psychiatry Research

## ðŸŽ¯ Introduction
LAM, the Large Audio Model, is an innovative project designed specifically for Psychiatry Research. This research is aimed at harnessing the power of machine learning to predict psychological or mental health states such as depression, anxiety, and more, based on speech cues. Our mission is to transform the way psychological assessments are done today by creating a more efficient, accurate, and time-saving model. 

With the increasing amount of research in this field, it has been observed that recognition efficiency and accuracy significantly improve with the model's complexity. However, this also leads to higher temporal complexity and increased time-consumption, which can be a setback for practical implementations. We recognize this problem and we are addressing it with LAM.

## ðŸ’¡ Why LAM?
The motivation behind LAM is to create a model that is both efficient and less complex without compromising on accuracy. LAM brings in the power of some baseline models such as Transformer, and combines it with attentional mechanisms to create a new, more robust structure.

LAM is built upon the simplest MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) structure, using a set of innovative modules such as Melspectrogram Filter Bank, Full-MLP, and Random Route Activate. This results in a model that reduces temporal complexity while maintaining high recognition efficiency and accuracy.

The implications of such a model are significant. It allows for more accessible and timely mental health assessments, which is crucial for early intervention and effective treatment. Moreover, it creates a platform for non-invasive, continuous monitoring of individuals who are at risk, making mental healthcare more proactive than reactive.

## ðŸŽ“ Research Goals
Our research revolves around improving the predictability of psychological states using audio cues. This includes:

- Advancing the MLP structure to create a model that is less complex but highly efficient.
- Enhancing the recognition efficiency and accuracy of psychological or mental health states.
- Improving the speed of these predictions, making it viable for real-time analysis and feedback.
- Contributing to the fields of AI in Psychiatry and Mental Health through our findings and tools.

In conclusion, the LAM project combines cutting-edge technology with a profound need for more accessible and efficient mental health resources. We look forward to seeing the impact this research will have on the mental health field, and we invite you to explore, contribute, and support our endeavor.

## ðŸš€ Future Work
We envision LAM as a continually evolving project. Our team is already working on the next steps, which include refining the model, making it more user-friendly, and ensuring that it can be easily integrated into mental health practices. Stay tuned for more updates and releases.
