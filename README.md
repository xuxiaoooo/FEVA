# ðŸŽ§ LAM (Large Audio Model) for Psychiatry Research

## ðŸŽ¯ Introduction
LAM, the Large Audio Model, is an innovative project designed specifically for Psychiatry Research. This research aims to employ machine learning techniques for predicting psychological or mental health states such as depression, anxiety, and more, based on speech cues. Our mission is to transform the way psychological assessments are conducted by creating a model that is efficient, accurate, and time-efficient. 

Current models based on speech cues significantly improve recognition efficiency and accuracy as their complexity increases. However, a consequence of this is a higher temporal complexity, leading to increased time consumption. Traditional attention mechanisms, despite their success in tasks like these, are notorious for their high computational cost. This is where LAM comes into the picture.

## ðŸ’¡ Why LAM?
LAM is our solution to the aforementioned challenge. It seeks to create a model that is both efficient and less complex, all without compromising on accuracy. 

The basis of LAM lies in the employment of a Filter-enhanced MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) structure, as opposed to the traditionally used attention mechanisms. This novel approach includes innovative modules such as the Melspectrogram Filter Bank, Full-MLP, and Random Route Activate. The result is a model that effectively reduces temporal complexity while maintaining high recognition efficiency and accuracy.

This is a significant advancement in the field of mental health assessments. By making them more accessible and timely, LAM lays the foundation for early intervention and effective treatment. Furthermore, it enables non-invasive, continuous monitoring of individuals at risk, pushing mental healthcare to be more proactive rather than reactive.

## ðŸŽ“ Research Goals
Our research revolves around improving the predictability of psychological states using audio cues. This includes:

- Developing a Filter-enhanced MLP structure that is less complex but highly efficient.
- Enhancing the recognition efficiency and accuracy of psychological or mental health states.
- Improving the speed of these predictions, making real-time analysis and feedback a reality.
- Contributing to the fields of AI in Psychiatry and Mental Health through our innovative solutions.

In conclusion, the LAM project brings together cutting-edge technology and the urgent need for more accessible and efficient mental health resources. We eagerly anticipate the impact this research will have on the mental health field.

## ðŸš€ Future Work
LAM is envisaged as an evolving project. Our team is already working on refining the model, enhancing its user-friendliness, and ensuring its seamless integration into mental health practices. Stay tuned for more updates and exciting releases.
